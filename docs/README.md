# Acknowledgements

In March 2015, [SNOMED International](http://snomed.org) generously licensed the Snow Owl Terminology Server components supporting SNOMED CT. They subsequently made the licensed code available to their [members](http://www.snomed.org/members) and the global community under an open-source license.

In March 2017, [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk) licensed the Snow Owl Terminology Server to support the mandatory adoption of SNOMED CT throughout all care settings in the United Kingdom by April 2020. In addition to driving the UKâ€™s clinical terminology efforts by providing a platform to author national clinical codes, Snow Owl will support the maintenance and improvement of the dm+d drug extension which alone is used in over 156 million electronic prescriptions per month. Improvements to the terminology server made under this agreement will be made available to the global community.
